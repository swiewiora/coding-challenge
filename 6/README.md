Customer Management System 
- We're going to start building a system for managing customers.
- We need to represent customers in the system somehow. At the moment we know we will need to record Name and Date of Birth.
- For reporting, we need to be able to calculate average age of customers - aggregate for all customers in the system and also separate statistics for males and females. 
- Design the solution
- Implement this functionality. Quickly test the code you have written using the Main method.
