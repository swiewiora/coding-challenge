Test 1:
Write a program that outputs sequentially the integers from 1 to 99 but on some conditions prints a string instead:
- when the integer is a multiple of 3 print “Open” instead of the number,
- when it is a multiple of 7 print “Source” instead of the number,
- when it is a multiple of both 3 and 7 print “OpenSource” instead of the number.

Test 2:
Solve the game "Guess a number", find a secret integer between 1 and 1000000
in less than 50 guesses. Write a function that solves the game without user input and returns the
solution by using the function verify() which is defined with the following
specification:
function verify(guess: integer) -> integer
Argument:
  guess (integer) the number to verify
Returns:
  0 if the guess is the solution, your program won
  -1 if the solution is smaller than the guess parameter
  1  if the solution is bigger than the guess parameter

Warning: You are not allowed to call verify() more that 50 times or you loose.

Test 3:
Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the sum of the list items that represents an integer (skipping the other items)

Test 4:
Write a recursive version of the previous function (or an iterative version if you already did a recursive version).

Test 5:
Write pseudo-SQL statements to create database tables to store the products of a basic webshop. Each product has a name, a price, a creation date and may belong to several categories. Categories have a name and a flag to indicate whether the category is private or public.
Write a SQL query to find the list of products that belong to more than 5 public categories.

Test 6:
Write a regular expression to match strings containing both "Odoo" and "#rules" in any order.
// return string with Odoo, any amount of characters and #rules or the same condition in reversed order

/Odoo.*#rules|#rules.*Odoo/

Test 7:
Write a function that, when called, returns an array for which each element is a letter of the alphabet, from "A" to "Z" (exactly once, in order and upper case). Your code cannot contain the character ' (quote), " (double quote) or ` (back quote)
